# Team Report

#### Previous Goals
- Keep trying to connect database and input sample data.
#### Key Points
- What was done
  - Discussed the entire structure of the project, including the overall goal and how each portion of the application will communicate with eachother. Since the application has multiple different parts to it, it was not completely apparent until now.
  - Set up the mobile API application to come online.   
- What worked
  - Using Azure web service to launch a web API.
- What was learned
  - How to manage the web services portion of Azure.
- Have trouble with
  - Creating the functions for the web API. This is what will handle all incoming requests and send outgoing requests all while ensuring the connection is stable.
- Stuck on
#### Next Week Goals

# Individual Reports

### Tyler Thompson
##### Previous Goals
- Fully learn JDoc documentation pages.
- Create a backend api to connect to database.
- Start adding test data to the database if everything goes smooth.
##### Key Points
- The C# backend for the web API requires C# coding standards to be followed. This includes try to use docstrings in which C# uses XML to format this.
- Deployed the web API, and set up a build file to push the newest changes as soon as commits to main happen.
- Started to try and use the terminal more when it comes to handling processes in each respective coding IDE as well as the shell used for the API and database. Trying to write down useful commands and keep them close by to learn them as fast as possible.
##### Next Week Goals
- Keep using the terminal.
- Continue working on the web API and reguardless if it is finished, give everyone a rundown of what each function will do as well as the parameters and what it returns. It will return a JSON format, but what type of information that is returned will be important.
- Keep researching best practices to see if there are better ways to complete the tasks I am doing.
  
### Aaron Feinberg
#### Previous Goals
- write unit tests for UI Activities 
- collaborate with UI team to create a standardized layout for our app to be shared among activities 
- look into location data for our app (with Syed) 

##### Key Points
- Wrote unit tests for signup and login activities (validating username/password requirements were met)
- Developed the validator object (Util) using TDD
- collaborated with Syed and Tazkir about restructuring the files and finishing activities for testing

What Im Stuck on
- when checking out between branches i am sometimes having issues with the smart checkout function on android studio. 
it claims to shelve my changes but sometimes it turns out they are deleted and it is difficult to restore them, 
especially after i realized when i made a new commit already. 

##### Next Week Goals
- Have a the UI end of our minimum viable product finished 
- Have tests written for all util functions on for these activities 
- move onto integrated and ui testing 

### Taazkir Nasir
##### Previous Goals
- Extend signup activity to get all pertinent user information 
- Create a few more mockups of the search page to visualize the final output
- Create user stories to flush out all possible functional requirements

##### Key Points
- Views will be finalized based on the team's input after the next meeting to be implemented 
- Same with user stories. Once they're finalized and confirmed, they will be added to the living document 
- Will need to make better use of the GitHub projects to manage the workload and make effort estimates

##### Next Week Goals
- Implement final UI components 
- Review the non-functional requirements related to user experience (UX)
- Extending signup will overflow into next week  

### Syed Ahmed
##### Previous Goals
- Refactor code to be line with the architecture for our app
- Look into integration with google maps

##### Key Points
- Overall, I spent this week trying getting a good grasp on the architectural pattern our android app, and refactoring the code to follow those patterns and principles. Although the functionally the app is the same, the outcome is clean, organized, and modularized code that's also more conducive for convinient testing and debugging.
- Additionally, I spent a lot time in discussing the code and architecture with the group members.

##### Next Week Goals
- Collaborate with Tyler on writing functions for the API
- Collaborate with Aaron on test-driven development

### Joseph Porrino
##### Previous goals
- Fix issues with webscraper in codespaces
- Set up custom docker container
- Research github actions

##### Keypoints
- Codespaces is unable to run a python project that uses selenium so we will be manually running the python script for the time being
- I finished the webscraper and have the data formatted in a Json. The will be inserted into a text document until connected to the database
- I started looking into pytest for unit testing

##### Next Week Goals
- Work with Tyler on getting the database connected
- Start unittesting code
