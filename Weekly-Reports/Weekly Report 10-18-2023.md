### Aaron Feinberg
#### Previous Goals

- collaborate with UI team to create a standardized layout for our app to be shared among activities 
- look into location data for our app (with Syed) 

##### Key Points
- Wrote unit tests for signup and login activities (validating username/password requirements were met)
- Developed the validator object (Util) using TDD
- collaborated with Syed and Tazkir about restructuring the files and finishing activities for testing

What Im Stuck on
- when checking out between branches i am sometimes having issues with the smart checkout function on android studio. 
it claims to shelve my changes but sometimes it turns out they are deleted and it is difficult to restore them, 
especially after i realized when i made a new commit already. 

##### Next Week Goals
- Have a the UI end of our minimum viable product finished 
- Have tests written for all util functions on for these activities 
- move onto integrated and ui testing 

### Taazkir Nasir
##### Previous Goals
- Extend signup activity to get all pertinent user information 
- Create a few more mockups of the search page to visualize the final output
- Create user stories to flush out all possible functional requirements

##### Key Points
- Views will be finalized based on the team's input after the next meeting to be implemented 
- Same with user stories. Once they're finalized and confirmed, they will be added to the living document 
- Will need to make better use of the GitHub projects to manage the workload and make effort estimates

##### Next Week Goals
- Implement final UI components 
- Review the non-functional requirements related to user experience (UX)
- Extending signup will overflow into next week  


### Syed Ahmed
##### Previous Goals
- Get an idea of how to integrate Google Maps API into our app
- Figure our what architecture we were using. We will separate components of the app into 3 layers: UI, logic, and data. 
We will take cues from google's guide to architectural principles <https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture>

##### Key Points
- I get the architecture in concept, but still not entirely sure how it looks like in code
- Collaborated with Aarron to understand our architecture and testing principles going forward

##### Next Week Goals
- Try to refactor some of the code to be in line
- Write code to implement google maps

### Joseph Porrino
##### Previous goals
- Automate the webscraper to search many items at once
- Connect to the database 
- Use github actions to automate webscraper

##### Keypoints
- I have not yet connected the webscraper to the database. Tyler had to make a design change on how we connect to the database. I am looking into the situation with him.
- I am working on setting up the webscraper in codespaces so that it can be automated but im running into issues with getting chrome to work. I may have to create
  a custom docker container to run the script.

##### Next Week Goals
- Fix issues with webscraper in codespaces
- Set up custom docker container
- Research github actions
