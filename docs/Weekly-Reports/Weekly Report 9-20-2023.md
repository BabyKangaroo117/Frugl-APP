# Team Report
##### Previous Goals
- Since this is the first team report there were no major goals from the previous week. People were researching their roles.
##### Key Points
- Began fleshing out Scrum meeting structure. Had role reassignments in certain areas to allow each programmer to learn what they are interested in. Each programmer researched respective areas. 
- Scrum meeting was successful, took sometime to get used to how it should be performed.
- Learned that we need simple setup of the database and API to get a understanding of how the application will communicate. This will allow front end developer roles to start working with basic inputs to get a feel for the layout of the application.
- Joe and Taazkir are appointed to the API portion. Syed is creating a prototype. Aaron is researching useful techniques and creating the login. Tyler and Taazkir are creating the database.
- Had trouble understanding which database we should use. Initially started out thinking about Firebase which is integrated with Android Studio, but it uses NOSQL which not what we were looking for in the project structure. 
- Stuck on discovering APIs that provide the information that we will need.
##### Next Week Goals
- Find APIs that will help find a way to show prices.
- Create a SQL Server database which is from Microsoft. Begin researching ways to connect it to Android Studio.
- General layout of the login feature in the application.
