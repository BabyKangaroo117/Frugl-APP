# Team Report

#### Previous Goals
- Find APIs that will help find a way to show prices.
- Create a SQL Server database which is from Microsoft. Begin researching ways to connect it to Android Studio.
- General layout of the login feature in the application.
#### Key Points
- Have a working version of a prototype, that includes an example login screen.
- Decided to go with webscrapping since store APIs did not get sufficient information needed to allow the application work.
- Learned how to webscrape.
- Learned how to create a Azure Database
- Struggled with database creation with free software.
- It is important for the database and web scrapping portion to come up with a working example, that way test inputs can be tested for formatting and correctness purposes. 
#### Next Week Goals
- Connect Database to the application.
- Keep improving on web scrapper.
- Flesh out front end portion.

# Individual Reports

### Tyler Thompson
##### Previous Goals
- Create the database server.
- Document the creation of the server.
##### Key Points
- Ended up going with a Microsoft Azure database to provide for cloud services and cheap alternative. Used a school account to acquire a portion of free money. 
- Database is set up and multiple test databases were created to see how they would function.
- Had trouble understanding what was actually needed.
- Learned that a server must made first, which allowed for the creation of the database.
##### Next Week Goals
- Begin connecting database to the application.
- Flesh out tables and ER diagram for the database.

### Joseph Porrino
#### Previous Goals
 - For the upcoming week my goal is to pull price data from Wegmans using python. I am going to use python and beautiful soup to pull the html and then sort through it.
##### Key Points
- I ended up using selenium to scrape Wegmans website because it uses java script which wasn't allowing a simple request to get the HTML. I was able to get the names and prices of every item on a page. This week I also fixed an issue with Syed on using activities in android studio.
##### Next Week Goals
- My plan is to polish up the webscraper so that it takes entries from the user on what data to gather. I also want to see how to set up the python code in the cloud so that I can call it from the app and it will return the data. This way we don't have to create a database of all the grocery items. Python anywhere is a potential option but i need to look into it. I also want to get the layout figured out on how we will display the data.

### Aaron Feinberg
#### Previous Goals
- My goal this week was to finish configuring my android studio environment and complete the first few sections of an android studio development course. In order to practice what i have learned, Syed and I have been working on the "Startup" branch...creating some example activities. I created the "About" activity for  our app with  an XML file and button on the main activity which directs you there.
##### Key Points
- Creating MVP for our app in android studio.
- Documenting the process.
- Learning to use android studio.
##### Next Week Goals
- Along with continuing to learn the android studio environment, I would like to start adding documentation to GitHub about the android studio development process. I will also include a small blurb about gradle as i just found out it is the tool which automatically gets dependencies one may need to run our program. I would also like to get through the next 2 sections of my Udemy course.

### Taazkir Nasir
##### Previous Goals
- Follow along online tutorial and set up scaffolding for the homepage and search page.
- Create Wire diagrams for each planned activity.

##### Key Points
- Sequence diagrams are needed to flush out the UI requirements.

##### Next Week Goals
- Create Sequence diagrams for login, signup, search, and grocery list use cases.
- Implement working buttons and text input fields.

### Syed Ahmed
##### Previous Goals
- My goal this week was to create the CreateList activity/view for our app. This activity allows the users to create their shopping list by searching their items from the search bar and adding it to their list.

##### Key Points
- Add feature for creating shopping list.
- Add search bar functionality.
##### Next Week Goals
- Add further functionality for editing items in a list.
